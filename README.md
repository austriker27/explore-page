## Recommended IDE Setup

This test project is showcasing my developer skills to build a website based on a provided design. I mostly adhered to making it pixel perfect although because I was only provided a single screen size I improvised in some specifics so that the end result is more responsive for all screen sizes and adheres to a global design system like offered in Tailwind.


## Deployment:

- CD setup for `main` branch, deployed on netlify
- https://david-explore-page.vercel.app/

## Features

- Responsive across mobile and desktop and tablet screensizes
- Accessibility focused code with aria-labels, etc
- Resusable Vue components for future flexibilty

## Areas to improve

- Integrate a more robust animation library like [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) or [VueUse's Motion](https://motion.vueuse.org/) library
- Image rendering: lazy loading and progressive rendering

## Uses

- Vuejs 3 with Vite
- Tailwind CSS
